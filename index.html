Each location grants a one-time coin reward, ensuring that users canâ€™t claim from the same place twice. 
                    ðŸ”— Redeeming Rewards:
                    Our website features a redemption system where users can redeem coins via a QR code, making the entire process seamless and digital. Coins can be scanned and redeemed for special tokens or rewards, adding a unique incentive for tourists to explore more places!</p>
